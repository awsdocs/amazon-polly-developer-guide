# Listening to the Voices<a name="listening-voices"></a>

You can use the Amazon Polly console to hear a sample from any of the voices available in Amazon Polly

**To listen to a voice in Amazon Polly**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Polly console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/polly/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/)\.

1. Choose the **Text\-to\-Speech** tab\.

1. For **Engine**, choose **Standard** or **Neural**\.

1. Choose a language and a Region, then choose a voice\.

1. Enter text for the voice to speak or use the default phrase, and then choose **Listen**\.

You can choose any of the languages offered by Amazon Polly and the console will display the voices available for that language\. In most cases, there will be at least one male and one female voice, often more than one of each\. A few only have a single voice\. For a complete list, see [Voices in Amazon Polly](voicelist.md)

**Note**  
The inventory of voices and the number of languages included is continually being updated to include additional choices\. To suggest a new language or voice, feel free to provide feedback on this page\. Unfortunately, we are not able to comment on plans for specific new languages be they are released\.

Each voice is created using native language speakers, so there are variations from voice to voice, even within the same language\. When selecting a voice for your project, you should test each of the possible voices with a passage of text to see which best suits your needs\.
