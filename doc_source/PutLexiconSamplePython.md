# PutLexicon<a name="PutLexiconSamplePython"></a>

The following code sample show how to use Python \(boto3\)\-based applications to store a pronunciation lexicon in an AWS Region\.

For more information on this operation, see the reference for the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_PutLexicon.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_PutLexicon.html) API\. 

Note the following:
+ You need to update the code by providing a local lexicon file name and a stored lexicon name\.
+ The example assumes you have lexicon files created in a subdirectory called `pls`\. You need to update the path as appropriate\.

The following code example uses default credentials stored in the AWS SDK configuration file\. For information about creating the configuration file, see [Step 3\.1: Set Up the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](setup-aws-cli.md)\.
