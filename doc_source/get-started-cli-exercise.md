# Step 3\.2: Getting Started Exercise Using the AWS CLI<a name="get-started-cli-exercise"></a>

Now you can test the speech synthesis offered by Amazon Polly\. In this exercise, you call the `SynthesizeSpeech` operation by passing in sample text\. You can save the resulting audio as a file and verify its content\. 

1. Run the `synthesize-speech` AWS CLI command to synthesize sample text to an audio file \(`hello.mp3`\)\. 

   The following AWS CLI example is formatted for Unix, Linux, and macOS\. For Windows, replace the backslash \(\\\) Unix continuation character at the end of each line with a caret \(^\) and use full quotation marks \("\) around the input text with single quotes \('\) for interior tags\.

   ```
   aws polly synthesize-speech \
       --output-format mp3 \
       --voice-id Joanna \
       --text 'Hello, my name is Joanna. I learned about the W3C on 10/3 of last year.' \
       hello.mp3
   ```

   In the call to `synthesize-speech`, you provide sample text for the synthesis, the voice to use \(by providing a voice ID, explained in the following step 3\), and the output format\. The command saves the resulting audio to the `hello.mp3` file\. 

   In addition to the MP3 file, the operation sends the following output to the console\.

   ```
   {
           "ContentType": "audio/mpeg", 
           "RequestCharacters": "71"
   }
   ```

1. Play the resulting `hello.mp3` file to verify the synthesized speech\.

1. Get the list of available voices by using the `DescribeVoices` operation\. Run the following `describe-voices` AWS CLI command\.

   ```
   aws polly describe-voices
   ```

   In response, Amazon Polly returns the list of all available voices\. For each voice, the response provides the following metadata: voice ID, language code, language name, and the gender of the voice\. The following is a sample response\.

   ```
   {
       "Voices": [
           {
               "Gender": "Female",
               "Name": "Salli",
               "LanguageName": "US English",
               "Id": "Salli",
               "LanguageCode": "en-US"
           },
           {
               "Gender": "Female",
               "Name": "Joanna",
               "LanguageName": "US English",
               "Id": "Joanna",
               "LanguageCode": "en-US"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Optionally, you can specify the language code to find the available voices for a specific language\. Amazon Polly supports dozens of voices\. The following example lists all the voices for Brazilian Portuguese\.

   ```
   aws polly describe-voices \
       --language-code pt-BR
   ```

   For a list of language codes, see [Languages Supported by Amazon Polly](SupportedLanguage.md)\. These language codes are W3C language identification tags \(*ISO 639 code for the language name*\-*ISO 3166 country code*\)\. For example, en\-US \(US English\), en\-GB \(British English\), and es\-ES \(Spanish\), etc\. 

   You can also use the `help` option in the AWS CLI to get the list of language codes:

   ```
   aws polly describe-voices help
   ```
