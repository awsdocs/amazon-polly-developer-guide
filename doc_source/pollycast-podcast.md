# Podcasting with Amazon Pollycast<a name="pollycast-podcast"></a>

With Amazon Pollycast feeds, your visitors can listen to your audio content using standard podcast applications\. RSS 2\.0\-compliant *Pollycast feeds* provide the XML data needed to aggregate podcasts by popular mobile podcast applications, such as iTunes, and podcast directories\. 

When you install the **AWS for WordPress** plugin, choose the ****ITunes explicit**** option to automatically add Amazon Pollycast endpoints to all WordPress archive URLs\. This lets you syndicate both site\-wide or targeted podcasts\. If you didn't choose the ****ITunes explicit**** option when you installed the plugin, follow these steps:

1. On the **WordPress Admin** page, choose **Settings**\.

1. On the **Settings** page, choose ****ITunes explicit****\.

You can add Amazon Pollycast endpoints manually by adding `/amazon-pollycast/` to the URL for a page in a podcasting application\. For example:

```
example.com/amazon-pollycast/
example.com/category/news/amazon-pollycast/
example.com/author/john/amazon-pollcast/
```

## Positioning the Player<a name="pollycast-html"></a>

When you install the **AWS for WordPress** plugin plugin, it displays an audio player at the top of your WordPress website by default unless you choose to display it under your site's text or to not display it\.

1. On the **WordPress Admin** page, choose **Settings**\.

1. On the **Amazon Polly Settings** page, for **Player position**, choose the appropriate option\.
