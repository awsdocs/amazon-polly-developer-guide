# Integrating CloudWatch with Amazon Polly<a name="cloud-watch"></a>

When you interact with Amazon Polly, it sends the following metrics and dimensions to CloudWatch every minute\. You can use the following procedures to view the metrics for Amazon Polly\.

You can monitor Amazon Polly using CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Amazon Polly into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access `historical information` and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. By default, Amazon Polly metric data is sent to CloudWatch in 1 minute intervals\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the Amazon *CloudWatch User Guide*\.

            "Dimensions": [
                {
                    "Name": "Operation", 
                    "Value": "SynthesizeSpeech"
                }
            ], 
            "MetricName": "ResponseLatency"
        }, 
        {
            "Namespace": "AWS/Polly",
