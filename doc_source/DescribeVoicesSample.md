# DescribeVoices<a name="DescribeVoicesSample"></a>

The following Java code sample show how to use Java\-based applications to produce a list of the voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis\. You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices\. For example, if you specify en\-US, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices\.

For more information on this operation, see the reference for the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html) API\.
