# Python Examples<a name="get-started-what-next"></a>

This guide provides additional examples, some of which are Python code examples that use AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\) to make API calls to Amazon Polly\. We recommend that you set up Python and test the example code provided in the following section\. For additional examples, see [Example Applications](examples-for-using-polly.md)\.

## Set Up Python and Test an Example \(SDK\)<a name="get-started-setup-python"></a>

To test the Python example code, you need the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\)\. For instruction, see [AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\) ](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/)\.

**To test the example Python code**

The following Python code example performs the following actions:
+ Uses the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\) to send a `SynthesizeSpeech` request to Amazon Polly \(by providing simple text as input\)\. 
+ Accesses the resulting audio stream in the response and saves the audio to a file \(`speech.mp3`\) on your local disk\.
+ Plays the audio file with the default audio player for your local system\.

Save the code to a file \(example\.py\) and run it\.

```
